## Purpose ##

This program does the same thing as the first Happy_Birthday, but instead of writing the note length in terms of seconds, it is written in terms of beats (where the beat period is defined by the user). This helps make note writing much more intuitive as musical note lengths are written in terms of the the number of beats they take (i.e. quarter note, whole note, half note).
