# MAE_151
## Music Box Project

The goal of the MAE 151 project is to develop a music box capable of detecting/catching a ball and dropping it to the next music box at specified times. Additionally, when the ball is detected and caught, the music box must play a short series of notes, which are a measure from a song, and light up LEDs at the same time. 

The most up-to-date program is "Complete_Test_With_LEDs". Please note that the current issue (2/20/19) is that the LED's cause interference with MIDI communication between the Music Instrument Shield, causing a high pitch noise to play in the background. From online (i.e. https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=451853.0),  I have found that this is not an uncommon issue and is most likely because the Serial protocol (which MIDI data is sent over) requiring precise timing, but the neopixel (and FastLED) library turn off the hardware interrrupts when sending data to the LED strip. The hypothesis that the LED strip was interfering with the MIDI signals was proven to be the issue when only the LEDs were actuated and the speaker began playing noises based on the LED patterns from the Neopixel example code. One current solution I have come up with was replacing the addressable LED strip with a non-addressable LED strip or high power LEDs instead. Even if the addressable LED strip worked, the workarounds that will be required will most likely limit the Arduino too much for this project.
