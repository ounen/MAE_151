# MAE_151
## Music Box Project

The goal of the MAE 151 project is to develop a music box capable of detecting/catching a ball and dropping it to the next music box at specified times. Additionally, when the ball is detected and caught, the music box must play a short series of notes, which are a measure from a song, and light up LEDs at the same time. 

The most up-to-date program is "Complete_Test_With_LEDs". Please note that the current issue (2/20/19) is the LED
