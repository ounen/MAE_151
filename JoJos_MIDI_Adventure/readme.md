This program was tested the ability for the MIDI shield to play a small part of the well-known JoJo's Bizzare Adventure opening song with. Utilizing the mapping between MIDI notes to musical notes, creating the notes to play the song was intuitive and quick to troubleshoot. 
It should be noted that to get this to work, the software serial pins must be set to pins 2 and 3. The current pins written in the code WILL NOT WORK!
