** Purpose **
The goal of this program was to test if software serial ports (other than 2 and 3) would work. However, this did not work. Had this worked, the hardware interrupt pins on the Arduino (2 and 3) could have been used to ensure that when the ball cuts the break-beam sensor, the Arduino would stop everything and run a predefined function.
